********************************

Using a matlab script to unpack landsat8 zipped images, read them into matlab, match utm coordinates to the landsat image, and extract data from the image based on the utm coordinates, and do some image manipulation (NDVI, Soil Moisture, etc). Some "3rd party scripts" were used, an url of them can be found in the script.
